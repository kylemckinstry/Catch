One of my earlier demo projects while doing General Assembly's Front-end Web Devlopment course in 2020. I created a small landing page replicating a retro Nintendo Game & Watch.

The project is built in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

I had a lot of fun creating the charming graphic design assets and playing with the detectKey, setInterval and positions.
